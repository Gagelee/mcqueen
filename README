This is an autonomous RC Car project using a Raspberry Pi, an Adafruit 16-channel PWM ESC/Servo driver.
It is based the wiringPi libraries.

The code in the 'car' directory is the main code being developed.  I am working on developing the C++ code required to make
the project in the leanest possible way, but with a structure that can be reused.  Based on my limited knowledge of the 
platform, I have started by heavily relying on libraries I could find and, as my knowledge grows, I am paring down the 
use of other code to avoid compiling stuff I will never use.


Thanks to the following people for contributions, inspiration, code and other help:

I used your tutorial on interfacing the Raspberry pi GPIO to build my gpio and pin classes. Thanks for sharing.

I don't think the world of the Raspberry Pi would exist today without you. I have leveraged wiringPi significantly
throughout this project.  A lot of code is still referencing it, although I am slowly disconnecting from it. Your website
is a goldmine for beginners like me, and not so beginners too.

I actually started this in Java and still think that there is some good stuff to do there.  It was convenient for me
to learn the platform in a familiar language and help me frame my thoughts in objects.  Most other libraries out there
aren't.
