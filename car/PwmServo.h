/*** This class requires a PWM controller class where to send the following commands:
 *
 * int init (void)							// resets controller
 * int isReady (void)						// returns 1 if controller is ready
 * int getPwmFrequency (void)				// Returns the current frequency
 * int getPwmResolution (void)				// Returns the current resolution used by the PWM controller
 * int setPwm (int channel, int data)		// Sets the start & stop PWM value for me (still figure out meRef)
 * int getPwm (int channel)					// Gets the stop value of the PWM
 * int printStatus (void)					// Sends detailed status of the controller to the screen

/* 50Hz is the typical clock for servos. it means the controller runs 50 cycles in 1 second,
 * which means that each cycle is 20ms. Servos typically require to be high for 1ms per frame
 * to be full on one side, 1.5ms to be in the middle and 2ms to be full on the other side.
 * If your controller is a PCA9685 (like the Adafruit 16-channel 12-bit controller), the 12-bit
 * definition means that your frame's scale goes from 0 to 4095.
 *
 * If your frame is 20ms and you want to be up for 1ms, you need to be up for 1/20th of the
 * size of your frame, which would be 4096 / 20 = 205.
